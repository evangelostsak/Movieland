- Jinja2 for dynamic templates
- CSS (with responsive grids, hover effects, and modern designs)

### **APIs:**
- OMDb API for fetching movie details.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.8+**
2. **pip**: Package installer for Python.
3. **OMDb API Key**: [Get your OMDb API key here](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).
4. **Flask Secret Key**: Generate a secure random key (e.g., `os.urandom(24)`).

---

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/evangelostsak/Movieland.git
cd MovieLand
```

---

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### **Step 3: Add Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```plaintext
OMDB_API_KEY=your_omdb_api_key
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_flask_secret_key
```

Or, set them manually in your deployment environment.

---

### **Step 4: Initialize the Database**
*Follow these steps to set up your database:*
1.	Open app.py and uncomment the following lines:
```bash
# Run once to create tables
with app.app_context():
    data.db.create_all()
```
2.	Run the app.py file:
```bash
python app.py
```

3. After running the script, the required database tables will be created in your database file (e.g., app.db).

4. Once the tables are created, comment out or remove the initialization code to prevent re-initializing the database in future runs.

---

### **Step 5: Run the Application**
Start the Flask development server:
```bash
flask run
```

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the app.
